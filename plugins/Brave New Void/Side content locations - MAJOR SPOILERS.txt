To get into the Western Houseless storyline, travel either to the western edge of auroran space bordering on vell-os space or check bars in Vella space. You also get referred there by the Auroran side content and the Federation, Vell-os, and Rebel storylines.

To get into the Arms Race storyline, accept the mission "Weapons shipment to Pyrogenesis I" from any Federation spob (random)

To get into the Drifter storyline, find the Drifter station next to the K-003 wormhole.

To get into the Into The Nebula storyline, complete the Kontik probe mission, get your combat rating up, and wait.

To get into the Auroran side content, check bars in Heraan space.

To get into the Fed side content, check bars in Fed space

To get into the Polaris side content, check P'a He in the P'ar Karo system. The "Tech side" of the Polaris storyline has also been repurposed as side content, with the Wraith branch being the main story.

The Vell-os side content is a little weird. It involves finding and landing on different uninhabited planets with some "mystical" aspect to it. I'm unsure how to give hints on this one without completely giving it away.

To get into the Pirate Side content, check the Viking bar after becoming guild-master.
